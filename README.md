# cdk-lib-examples

This project contains example code for my talk "Deep dive on CDK: Tradeoffs when developing constructs & libraries" on AWS Community Day Germany 2023.

> When developing CDK constructs or libraries there is often several ways to achieve similar outcomes. This talk will dive deep on some of these decisions, compare the options and with that give the audience information to pick the best option for themselfes.
> 
> Examples for these options are eg project setup (projen or not), structuring constructs and their properties or how to hook into CDK for custom checks.
